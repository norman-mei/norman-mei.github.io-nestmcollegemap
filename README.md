## üöÄ Quick Start

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/<repo>.git
    cd <repo>
    ```2.  **Add a Google Maps API key**
    *   Create a key in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    *   Enable the **Maps JavaScript API**.
    *   Open `index.html` and find the `<script>` tag at the very bottom.
    *   Replace `YOUR_KEY` with your actual API key in the `src` attribute:
        ```html
        <script async src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_KEY&callback=initializeApp..."></script>
        ```
3.  **Serve the site**
    Because of browser security policies (CORS), you cannot open `index.html` directly from the filesystem. You must use a local web server.
    *   **Using VS Code:** Install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension and click "Go Live".
    *   **Using Python:**
        ```bash
        # Python 3
        python -m http.server
        ```
    *   **Using Node.js:**
        ```bash
        # Install serve globally
        npm install -g serve
        # Run the server
        serve .
        ```
    Then, open your browser to the local address provided (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).
