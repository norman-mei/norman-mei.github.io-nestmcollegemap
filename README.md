## üöÄ Quick¬†Start

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your‚Äëuser>/<repo>.git
   cd college-destinations-map
   ```
2. **Add a Google¬†Maps API key**

   * Create a key in the *Google¬†Cloud Console* with the **Maps¬†JavaScript‚ÄØAPI** enabled.
   * Open `collegemap25.html` and replace the placeholder in the `<script¬†src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_KEY&callback=initializeApp">` tag.
3. **Serve the site**
   Any static HTTP server works; for example with `serve`:

   ```bash
   npm install -g serve
   serve .
   ```

   Then browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

> **Tip**¬†‚ÄØMost browsers block local JSON requests when opening an HTML file directly.  Use a simple server instead.
