And while she might pull up to school fashionably late, she always comes prepared with her signature iced hazelnut latte üå∞ and apple tartüçé in hand üòâ. O Captain, my Captain‚Ä¶ this volleyball powerhouse has even held the Captain title two years in a row üëëüë∏üèº! Beyond her volleyball expertise, Tiernan is also a certified baddie always popping out with a fresh new set üíÖüèº. As she finally embarks on her journey to Lewisburg, we hope she‚Äôll find sushi that will meet her standards üç£üòã (and a good fork to eat her ice cream with üç®). And while the views at Bucknell may not compare to her fav city Prague üá®üáø, she‚Äôll be sure to get some good pics at the picturesque campus üì∏üì∏. After 13 years at NEST, it‚Äôs suffice to say that Tiernan has made her mark. We‚Äôre gonna miss her ability to strike up a convo with anyone and always make them laugh! But we know she will be migrating onto bigger places and reaching new heights ‚õ∞Ô∏è off at college. Congratulations Tiernan, we are so proud of you! Bucknell got a good one ü´∂. Gooooo Bison!!! ü¶¨ P. S. we know your cats will miss you‚Ä¶ üêàüêà‚Äç‚¨õ"
